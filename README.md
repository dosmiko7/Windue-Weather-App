# Windue - Weather App

Windue is a simple, user-friendly application that allows you to check the current weather forecast in various locations around the world. The application offers an intuitive user interface.

In addition to the temperature and general condition, it also shows information such as pressure, wind speed, chance of precipitation and much more.

## 📌 Geolocation
Thanks to the use of geolocation, the application can automatically find the weather for your coordinates. However, if you do not wish to provide such information, you can search for the name of your town.

The application also displays the nearest towns for which you can also check the weather

## 🗺️ Map
You can find a town on the map. Thanks to the use of OpenStreetMap API and OpenWeather API, we can enable various modes that graphically present information about temperature, wind, cloud cover, humidity and pressure.
